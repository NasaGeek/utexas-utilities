CHANGELOG (started this a bit late, oh well)

Versioncode 6, Version 1.05

Most likely added the ability to view Data Usage
Fixed an issue causing certain transactions to show inconsistent dates
Transaction view always reloads upon viewing as opposed to showing a cached version until being manually reloaded
Changed how bus schedules are displayed to prevent "stacking" of toasts
Bus schedule requests are threaded now, should prevent hanging while waiting to query for the times
Ability to view exam schedule  (removed for now as it serves no real purpose)
	long press item to see where it is on the map
	
Fixed a bug where you can only see a blank schedule when logged in through UTDirect
Fixed a bug causing a force close after logging in through UTDirect
Reworked the login system to produce less lag when loading parts of the app
Course schedule now has a slightly configurable background
Preferences moved around a bit to reflect new features

Okay, at this point it might as well be a 1.5/2.0 release.
ActionBar added along with all accompanying shiny features.

Versioncode 2

Changed preferences to make the functions of some of them more clear.
Button added to map to return to user's current location.
Preference added to choose where to center map upon initial load.
Times of operation added to dining menus.

Versioncode 3

Fixed bug with Login button state when no internet connectivity is present
