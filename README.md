# UT Utilities

## About
UT Utilities is an Android app made for University of Texas at Austin students to help them access useful UT web services through an intuitive mobile interface. It was originally conceived and created while I was a Freshman at UT in 2011, and development has continued since then. It was made available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nasageek.utexasutilities) in May 2012.

## Contributing
It'd be really awesome if people felt like contributing to this project. Ya'know, open source community and all that. I'd add your name to a list of contributors in this readme, as well as in the About page of the app.

## Building
Regardless of what IDE you use, if you want the campus map to function you'll need a [Google Maps Android API v2](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get_an_android_certificate_and_the_google_maps_api_key) key.

It should be possible to build UT Utilities using Gradle and Android Studio with no additional configuration. Gradle support is due almost entirely to [Henri Sweers'](https://github.com/hzsweers) efforts. Thanks!
