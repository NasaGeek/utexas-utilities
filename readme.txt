In order to compile this project you'll need to grab a few libraries:

ActionBarSherlock
Google Play Services
PanesLibrary (custom fork required from my github - https://github.com/NasaGeek/Android-PanesLibrary)

UTilities should build fine with the most recent versions of all of the above libraries

There are also a couple of included 3rd party libraries necessary for building UTilities:
AndroidPlot - http://androidplot.com/
AmazingListView (heavily modified) - https://code.google.com/p/android-amazing-listview/ 
Android Support Library - http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/index.html
ACRA - http://acra.ch/

You'll also need a Google Maps V2 API key to have maps functionality
