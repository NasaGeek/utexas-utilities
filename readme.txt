In order to compile this project you'll need to grab a few libraries:

ActionBarSherlock
SlidingMenu
Google Play Services
Android Support Library (just a jar)
PanesLibrary (heavily modified, zip available on googlecode downloads)

UTilities should compile fine with the most recent versions of all of these libraries
