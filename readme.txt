In order to compile this project you'll need to grab a few libraries:

ActionBarSherlock
Google Play Services
Android Support Library (just a jar)
PanesLibrary (custom fork available from my github)

UTilities should build fine with the most recent versions of all of these libraries

You'll also need a Google Maps V2 API key to have maps functionality
